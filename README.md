An intelligent helpdesk tool that automatically triages incoming support tickets, prioritizes them, and suggests responses using **AI/NLP**.  
Built with **FastAPI, Hugging Face, PostgreSQL, and React** — this project demonstrates real-world **AI + backend + frontend + cloud deployment** skills.

---

## 🚧 Current Phase

**Phase 2 – Core Features (In progress 🚀)**  
✅ Ticket filters (intent/sentiment/priority).  
✅ Agent dashboard (React).  
🚧 Smart Suggestions MVP.  

*Next: Phase 3 – Cloud + DevOps  

---

## ✨ Features (current + planned)

- **AI-Powered Classification (Phase 1)**  
  - Hugging Face zero-shot for **intent classification**.  
  - Sentiment analysis (negative/neutral/positive).  
  - Deterministic **priority rules** layered on model outputs.  
  - Confidence thresholds + near-tie detection.  

- **Ticket Persistence (Phase 1)**  
  - FastAPI endpoints store tickets in PostgreSQL.  
  - Classifications saved alongside tickets.  
  - Pagination and retrieval endpoints.  

- **Smart Suggestions (Phase 2+)**  
  - Suggest KB articles or past resolutions using embeddings.  

- **Feedback Loop (Phase 4)**  
  - Agents can accept/reject/edit suggestions for retraining.  

- **Multi-Language Support (Phase 4)**  
  - Auto-detect ticket language, route to bilingual agent or translate.  

- **Agent Dashboard (Phase 2+)**  
  - Ticket list + filters (intent, sentiment, priority).  
  - Ticket detail with AI classification + suggestions.  
  - Analytics (trends, model accuracy).  

- **Cloud Deployment (Phase 3+)**  
  - Dockerized backend + DB.  
  - AWS (EC2, RDS, S3, Lambda).  
  - CI/CD with GitHub Actions.
