An intelligent helpdesk tool that automatically triages incoming support tickets, prioritizes them, and suggests responses using **AI/NLP**.  
Built with **FastAPI, Hugging Face, PostgreSQL, React, and AWS** — this project demonstrates real-world **AI + backend + frontend + cloud deployment** skills.

## 🚧 Current Phase

**Phase 1 – Repository Hygiene & Foundation** *(In Progress)*
- ✅ Project structure and documentation
- ✅ Code style and linting setup (Black + Ruff)
- ✅ Contributing guidelines and pre-commit hooks
- ✅ License and basic repository polish
- 🔄 NLP model decisions and configuration
- 🔄 API contracts specification (OpenAPI)
- 🔄 Database schema documentation
- 🔄 Environment configuration templates
- 🔄 Architecture mapping and component layout
- 🔄 Data seeding strategy

*Next: Phase 2 – Core AI Features (NLP classification + sentiment analysis)*

---

## ✨ Features

- **AI-Powered Classification**
  - Pre-trained NLP model (Hugging Face / spaCy) for **intent + sentiment analysis**.
  - Auto-tags tickets by topic (e.g., billing, login, bug, feature request).
  - Detects urgency based on sentiment → assigns **priority levels**.

- **Smart Suggestions**
  - ML model analyzes past resolutions + knowledge base.
  - Suggests **reply templates or KB articles** to support agents.
  - Improves agent efficiency and speeds up customer response times.

- **Feedback Loop**
  - Agents can **accept/reject/edit AI suggestions**.
  - Feedback stored → used for **continuous model improvement**.
  - Demonstrates **ML deployment + iteration cycle**.

- **Multi-Language Support**
  - Detects ticket language automatically.
  - Routes to bilingual agents OR translates using APIs (DeepL/Google Translate).
  - Expands system usability for global teams.

- **Dashboard (React/Vue)**
  - Ticket list with filters (topic, priority, status).
  - Ticket detail view with AI predictions + suggested responses.
  - Analytics (tickets by category, sentiment trends, AI accuracy).

- **Cloud-Native Deployment**
  - **FastAPI backend** containerized with Docker.
  - **PostgreSQL** for ticket + feedback storage.
  - **AWS EC2 + RDS + S3** for scalable deployment.
  - Optional: **AWS Lambda** for serverless AI inference.

## 📊 System Architecture

![System Diagram](docs/system-diagram.png)

### System Flow

1. **Ticket Created** (via API, email, or Slack webhook).  
2. **NLP Pipeline**:
   - Detect language.  
   - Classify intent/topic.  
   - Analyze sentiment (positive, neutral, negative).  
3. **Priority Assignment** based on rules (e.g., "billing + negative" = high priority).  
4. **Smart Suggestions**: ML model retrieves similar past resolutions or KB articles.  
5. **Dashboard**: Agent reviews classification + suggestions.  
6. **Feedback**: Agent accepts/rejects → stored for model re-training.
