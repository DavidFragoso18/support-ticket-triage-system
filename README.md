# 🎟️ AI-Powered Support Ticket Triage System

An intelligent helpdesk tool that automatically triages incoming support tickets, prioritizes them, and suggests responses using **AI/NLP**.  
Built with **FastAPI, Hugging Face, PostgreSQL, React, and AWS** — this project demonstrates real-world **AI + backend + frontend + cloud deployment** skills.

---

## ✨ Features

- **AI-Powered Classification**
  - Pre-trained NLP model (Hugging Face / spaCy) for **intent + sentiment analysis**.
  - Auto-tags tickets by topic (e.g., billing, login, bug, feature request).
  - Detects urgency based on sentiment → assigns **priority levels**.

- **Smart Suggestions**
  - ML model analyzes past resolutions + knowledge base.
  - Suggests **reply templates or KB articles** to support agents.
  - Improves agent efficiency and speeds up customer response times.

- **Feedback Loop**
  - Agents can **accept/reject/edit AI suggestions**.
  - Feedback stored → used for **continuous model improvement**.
  - Demonstrates **ML deployment + iteration cycle**.

- **Multi-Language Support**
  - Detects ticket language automatically.
  - Routes to bilingual agents OR translates using APIs (DeepL/Google Translate).
  - Expands system usability for global teams.

- **Dashboard (React/Vue)**
  - Ticket list with filters (topic, priority, status).
  - Ticket detail view with AI predictions + suggested responses.
  - Analytics (tickets by category, sentiment trends, AI accuracy).

- **Cloud-Native Deployment**
  - **FastAPI backend** containerized with Docker.
  - **PostgreSQL** for ticket + feedback storage.
  - **AWS EC2 + RDS + S3** for scalable deployment.
  - Optional: **AWS Lambda** for serverless AI inference.

## 📊 System Flow

1. **Ticket Created** (via API, email, or Slack webhook).  
2. **NLP Pipeline**:
   - Detect language.  
   - Classify intent/topic.  
   - Analyze sentiment (positive, neutral, negative).  
3. **Priority Assignment** based on rules (e.g., "billing + negative" = high priority).  
4. **Smart Suggestions**: ML model retrieves similar past resolutions or KB articles.  
5. **Dashboard**: Agent reviews classification + suggestions.  
6. **Feedback**: Agent accepts/rejects → stored for model re-training.

## 🗺 Roadmap

### Phase 1 – Foundations (Week 1–2)  
- [x] Setup repo + FastAPI + PostgreSQL.  
- [x] Integrate Hugging Face zero-shot classifier.  

### Phase 2 – Core Features (Week 3–4)  
- [ ] Ticket classification (intent + sentiment).  
- [ ] Priority rules.  
- [ ] Basic dashboard.  
- [ ] Smart Suggestions (from KB + past tickets).  

### Phase 3 – Cloud + DevOps (Week 5–6)  
- [ ] Dockerize backend + DB.  
- [ ] Deploy to AWS (EC2 + RDS + S3).  
- [ ] CI/CD with GitHub Actions.  

### Phase 4 – Advanced AI (Week 7–8)  
- [ ] Feedback Loop (agent corrections → retraining).  
- [ ] Smart Suggestions upgrade (vector search for relevance).  
- [ ] Multi-Language Support (detection + translation).  
- [ ] Fine-tune NLP model on support ticket dataset.  

### Phase 5 – Portfolio Polish (Week 9)  
- [ ] Analytics dashboard (ticket trends, AI accuracy).  
- [ ] API docs (Swagger, FastAPI auto-docs).  
- [ ] System diagram in docs/.  
- [ ] Demo video (ticket → AI classification → suggestions → feedback).
